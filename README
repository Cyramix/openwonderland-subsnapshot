This is an Open Wonderland module to save world snapshots. It is being developed collaborative by the 
Open Wonderland Community, mainly during the Wedsnesday Dev meetings.



Testing with Junit

A Junit testing target has been added to the build file. It is all a bit messy
due to the complexity of the Wonderland building system. If you want to execute
the test cases, a recent copy of Wonderland.jar has to be unzipped in the
lib_test folder.

ant test --- will execute the test cases (in this case it is testing the addToZip
 method in the SubsnapshotContextMenuFactory class.)
