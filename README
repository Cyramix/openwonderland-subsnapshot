This is an Open Wonderland module to save world snapshots. It is being developed collaborative by the 
Open Wonderland Community, mainly during the Wedsnesday Dev meetings.



Testing with Junit

A Junit testing target has been added to the build file. It is all a bit messy
due to the complexity of the Wonderland building system. The usual wonderland setup 
regarding sources should be in place. Tests depend on some resources being compiled and
available so building wonderland(core) and modules might be needed beforehand.

ant test --- will execute the test cases (in this case it is testing the addToZip
 method in the SubsnapshotContextMenuFactory class.)
